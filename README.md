# Object-Oriented-Programming

A simple project aimed at learning object-oriented programming and also learning to use interfaces in c#
The project is a simple game in which there are animals that can be fed, and a counter will appear in front of you. If you do not feed them before the time period ends, the animal will die. You can sell animal products as well.

I hope you have a fun game.
